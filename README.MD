Operative Research Journey

Description:
Welcome to my exploration of the fascinating world of Operative Research (OR)! This repository chronicles my progress through various exercises, showcasing the exciting applications of OR methodologies.

Requirements:

AMPL software (https://ampl.com/)
CPLEX solver (https://www.gurobi.com/solutions/gurobi-optimizer)

Organization:

This repository is structured to maintain clarity and accessibility:

Exercises: Each exercise has its own folder, containing:
The AMPL model file (.mod) outlining the problem formulation.
Any relevant data files (.dat) used in the model.
Optional: A solution file (.sol) or a text file explaining the approach and insights.
Timetable_ricerca_operativa.numbers: This file captures the course schedule for reference.

Getting Started:
- Install AMPL and CPLEX: Follow the official documentation links provided above.
- Navigate to an exercise folder: Use your terminal or command prompt to access a specific exercise directory.
- Run the model: Execute the AMPL command ampl your_model_name.mod to solve the problem and display the results.
